            <h2 style="color: #36454F;"> Why choose us for your snowbird shipping?</h2>

            <p>Shipping your vehicle with the Auto Transportation Center will make your journey more smooth and fast. In
                addition, there are various benefits of hiring a Snowbird auto shipping company.</p>

            <h4>It is safe</h4>

            <p>When you travel a long distance, it will result in more wear and tear. Trusting a reliable company for
                shipping your vehicle will eliminate the risk of damages.</p>

            <h4>Saves money and time.</h4>

            <p>Driving a vehicle from northern states to southern states can be a difficult and time-consuming task.
                Additional expenses also occur, like fuel, accommodation, snacks, etc. Using a Snowbird auto shipping
                company will save you money.</p>

            <h4>Its stress-free</h4>

            <p>Driving to an unfamiliar route can cause you stress. It also has a fear of getting lost, and
                long-distance driving can be stressful.</p>

            <h2 style="color: #36454F;"> How much does Snowbird auto shipping cost?</h2>

            <p>The cost of snowbird car shipping depends on various factors. Let's know more about the factors that
                affect the cost of snowbird shipping.</p>

            <h4>Distance </h4>

            <p>This is the major factor that affects the cost of transportation. The longer the distance your vehicle
                will cover, the more you have to pay.</p>

            <h4>Type of vehicle</h4>

            <p>The bug and valuable vehicles require more attention and care, which will increase the cost of Snowbird
                auto shipping.</p>

            <h4>Type of service you opt for</h4>

            <p>Usually, people ship their vehicle in an open trailer, but if you want to ship your vehicle in an
                enclosed trailer, then be ready to spend 35-50% more.</p>
                <img class="w-100 pb-4 h-100"  src="https://autotransportationcenter.com/img/Winter-Car-shipping-ATC.webp">
            <h2 style="color: #36454F;">How do you prepare your vehicle for snowbird auto shipping?</h2>

            <p>While we are taking the responsibility of taking care of your vehicle during the whole transportation
                process, it is your responsibility to prepare your vehicle for shipping. Let's see how you can prepare
                your vehicle for Snowbird auto shipping.</p>

            <h4>Wash your vehicle thoroughly.</h4>

            <p>To get a clear look at your car, wash it thoroughly, which will help you mark all the pre-existing
                damages to the vehicle. And don't forget to take pictures from all sides if in case some damage happens
                during the transportation.</p>

            <h4>Remove all the loose parts. </h4>

            <p>We highly recommend you remove all the loose items attached to your vehicle. This can cause problems in
                transportation.</p>

            <h4>Remove all the personal stuff.</h4>

            <p>Remember not to leave any personnel stuff in your vehicle, like charging cables or water bottles in your
                vehicle. If you want to ship some personal items, we recommend you put them in the trunk with a maximum
                weight of 100 pounds.</p>

            <h4>Carry out the necessary maintenance.</h4>

            <p>Make sure all the tires are fully inflated and have a fully charged car battery. </p>

            <h4>Limit the tank fuel.</h4>

            <p>The tank should be filled with 1/8 or 1/4 of its full capacity.</p>

            <h2 style="color: #36454F;">Which type of transportation method will suit the best for snowbird shipping?
            </h2>

            <p>There are mainly two types of methods of transportation that people usually choose. One is open auto
                transport, and the second is enclosed auto transport.</p>

            <h4>Open car shipping</h4>

            <p>In this method, vehicles are transported in an open carrier with 8-10 other vehicles. This method is more
                affordable than enclosed auto transport.</p>

            <h4>Enclosed auto transport</h4>

            <p>This method is more safe and more secure in comparison to open car shipping. But this method is a bit
                costly in comparison to Open car shipping. We recommend this method for luxury and valuable vehicles.
            </p>
