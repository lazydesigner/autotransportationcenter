            <h2 style="color: #36454F;"> Heavy Equipment Transport</h2>

            <p>Auto Transportation Center can handle any type of heavy equipment, shipping responsibly. We transport it
                to the desired destination safely and fast as it comes in all different shapes and sizes. Let's delve
                into a brief discussion about heavy hauling services.</p>

            <h2 style="color: #36454F;"> What is Heavy Equipment Transport?</h2>

            <p>Whether you want to ship construction gear, industrial equipment, or any other type of heavy equipment,
                it is not an easy task to ship all these heavy equipment. It requires special care and experience in
                handling vehicles. Professionals are required to ship large vehicles, and some specialists are required
                to move the items on and off from a flatbed truck.</p>

            <p>Carrier options may range from flatbed trailers and lowboy trucks to step deck trailers and RGN.</p>

            <h2 style="color: #36454F;"> How does the Auto Transportation Center ship your Heavy Equipment?</h2>

            <p>The process of transporting heavy equipment is quite simple and involves the following five steps:</p>

            <h5>STEP#1: Get your instant quote</h5>

            <p>Use our instant online quote calculator to get an estimate on heavy equipment shipping, and one of our
                specialists will contact you via phone or email to discuss further details about heavy machinery
                transport.</p>

            <p>If you are fine with our price quotation and decide to ship your vehicle with Auto Transportation Center,
                then it is necessary to deposit some documents before the shipping takes place. The required documents
                are as follows:</p>

            <p>A certificate of title or bill of state to prove the ownership of the large vehicle.
                Measurements of the heavy equipment that is going to be shipped.
                A power of attorney form that will give us the right to handle your vehicle.
                Indentification of both the parties.</p>

            <h5>Step#2: Calculate the dimensions</h5>

            <p>It is required to know the exact dimensions of your heavy equipment that is going to be shipped to pair
                it with the best carrier type. So closely measure your heavy equipment:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Length (between 48-65 feet)</li>
                <li>Height ( desired height is 13 feet 6 inches) </li>
                <li>Weight </li>
                <li>Width ( 8 feet 6 inches)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Measure your machinery by yourself to determine the height and weight of your machinery. Measurement of
                the machinery can help us to know that your will fits in the regulations of the state where it is going
                to be transported.</p>

            <h5>Step#3: Choose the trailer type</h5>

            <p>Once you provide the measurements of your heavy hauling equipment. So now it's time to choose the best
                trailer, driver, and truck that is best suited to you. Our specialists will decide this, and it will be
                based on the information that you have provided to us. Usually, flatbed haulers are used to ship heavy
                equipment. </p>

            <p>We are a reputed heavy equipment transportation company; we have hundreds of highly skilled drivers who
                know how to load and unload heavy equipment safely.</p>

            <h5>Step#4: Prepare your heavy equipment for transportation</h5>

            <p>Preparation involves washing and removing the mud from your heavy equipment, which can add weight and
                increase the fuel cost. The driver would be legally responsible for any kind of damage, including debris
                and rocks. That is why washing your machinery ensures safety during transportation.</p>

            <p>The following instructions should be adapted during heavy hauling. Some equipment hauling services
                suggest disconnecting batteries and latching doors to add more safety.</p>

            <h4>Other than that, you have to:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Cover smokestacks and secure the covering properly.</li>
                <li>Adjust the hoists and booms to fit in the state regulation where it is being transported.</li>
                <li>Select a suitable place for loading and unloading your heavy equipment; there should be sufficient
                    space for safe loading and unloading.</li>

            </ul>

            <h5>Step#5: Delivery of your Heavy Equipment</h5>

            <p>It is important for someone to be there to pick up the heavy equipment when it is about to reach its
                destination. Do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions regarding the transportation
                service. Our specialists are available 24/7 to answer your questions.</p>

            <h2 style="color: #36454F;"> How much does Heavy Hauling service cost?</h2>

            <p>We don't have any accurate answer to this question. If we compare the standard methods of shipping, heavy
                hauling is more expensive. It is because of the cost of the fuel and lack of demand. Heavy hauling
                prices depend on weight and dimensions as well. </p>

            <h4>Transportation method</h4>


            <p>The transportation method helps in determining the cost of your heavy equipment. The most common and
                cheap method of transporting heavy equipment is roll-on-roll-off (RORO), and it is best for wheeled
                equipment.</p>

            <p>Containers of 20 feet and 40 feet are the best options for nonmoving heavy equipment by which we
                dismantle it for transportation and reassemble it when they reach their desired location.</p>

            <h2 style="color: #36454F;"> How much time do we take for Heavy Equipment Transportation?</h2>

            <p>The distance that is going to be covered plays an important role in determining the time of the
                transportation. Other factors that affect the time of the delivery are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Mode of transportation</li>
                <li>Oversized loads</li>
                <li>Regulations of the state where it is going to be delivered.</li>

            <h2 style="color: #36454F;"> Tips on transporting your heavy equipment</h2>

            <p>For that, you have to answer some questions like, does your machinery require special handling? Does the
                machinery require to get dismantled, or can it be fit in a trailer? Does your machinery require
                forklifts or cranes for pickup and delivery?</p>

            <p>Unexpected things can happen at any time, even if you prepare and plan too well for shipping. Due to some
                unexpected zones, drivers have to choose different routes, which will affect the time and cost of heavy
                equipment transportation.</p>
