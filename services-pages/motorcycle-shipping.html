            <p>The average cost of shipping a motorcycle is between $350 to $700 for the approximate distance of 1000
                miles. For the shipments under 1000 miles, we gave motorcycle shipping price that ranges between $180 to
                $300. Other than that, the cost depends on these various factors:</p>
            <ul>

                <li>Distance </li>
                <li>Make and model</li>

            <h2 style="color: #36454F;"> Time in transporting a motorcycle across the country.</h2>

            <p>The time of transportation depends on the location where you want to ship your vehicles and the route
                that has been chosen; generally, it takes 15-30 business days to ship the motorcycle. If you want your
                motorcycle shipping on an urgent basis, then we have the option of expedited shipping service.</p>

            <h2 style="color: #36454F;"> How do you prepare your motorcycle for shipping?</h2>
