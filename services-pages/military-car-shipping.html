            <p>People usually acknowledge this service as military vehicle shipping. This service is specially for
                military personnel; it doesn't matter whether you are a retired or active military person. You can

                experience smooth and easy.</p>

            <h2 style="color: #36454F;">How does military car shipping work?</h2>

            <p>Military vehicle shipping works the same as other services do. The government may charge the cost of POV
                shipment.</p>

                <img class="w-100 pb-4 h-100"  src="https://autotransportationcenter.com/img/military-car-shipping-ATC1.webp">

            <h2 style="color: #36454F;"> Military discounts to ship a car.</h2>

            <p>We provide military discounts to transport a vehicle for active and retired military members. Whenever
                you get in contact with a military car shipping company, always remember to ask for discounts from
                them.</p>

            <h2 style="color: #36454F;"> How much does Military vehicle transport cost?</h2>

            <p>The cost of shipping a PCS depends on different factors.</p>
            <ul>

                <li>The make and model</li>
                <li>Distance</li>
                <li>Timeframe</li>
                <li>Transportation method</li>
                <li>Condition of the vehicle</li>
                <li>Location</li>
                <li>Time of the year</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 style="color: #36454F;"> How does our military car transport service work?</h2>

            <p>We provide a quick and easy transportation process. Have a look at our three simple steps to book your
                order.</p>

            <h4>Get the quote and place your order.</h4>

            <p>Use our instant online quote calculator to get a military car shipping estimate. It will take only a few
                seconds to get your quote.</p>

            <h4>We pick your vehicle.</h4>

            <p>After placing your order, we will call you to schedule the pickup of your military vehicle. We will
                assign a professional driver to ship your military vehicle.</p>

            <h4>Delivery of your vehicle</h4>

            <p>Before arrival, our carrier driver will call to ensure the availability of the customer. It is important
                to be there at the time of delivery. If you have not been able to come, then arrange a representative
                who can receive the vehicle on your behalf. But make sure he should not be a minor; he/she should be
                18+. .</p>
                <img class="w-100 pb-4 h-100"  src="https://autotransportationcenter.com/img/military-car-shipping_ATC.webp">
            <h2 style="color: #36454F;"> What transportation method is best for you?</h2>

            <p>Military personnel usually choose open-car shipping whether they are active or retired military people.
                Door-to-door delivery will also be best for you. In all services, we give our best so that our customers
                don't have to face any inconvenience.</p>

            <h4>Open auto transportation</h4>

            <p>Open car shipping is the most affordable and economical car shipping service. In this method, your
                vehicle will be loaded on an open carrier and it will be exposed to the outside elements like dirt.</p>

            <h4>Enclosed Auto Transportation</h4>

            <p>Enclosed carriers are a bit costly in comparison to open carriers but this will protect your vehicle very
                nicely. It is best suited for luxury and customized vehicles.</p>

            <h2 style="color: #36454F;"> Advantages of using our Military car shipping service.</h2>

            <p>There are several advantages of using our military vehicle shipping. Some of them are as follows:.</p>

            <h4>Simple pickup and delivery process</h4>

            <p>Just provide us with all the important details, and your military vehicle transport will be a smooth and
                stress-free process. We ensure that our carrier picks up and drops off the vehicle as per your need. It
                doesn't matter whether you choose open-car shipping or enclosed-car shipping.</p>

            <h4>We provide military car shipping discounts.</h4>

            <p>Our military vehicle transport quote has a discount reserve, National guards, active duty, and military
                dependents. It's our way of saying thanks to the guard of our country.</p>

            <h4>Additional stuff allowed</h4>

            <p>We allowed one suitcase or box to ship in the military vehicle without any extra cost. But it should
