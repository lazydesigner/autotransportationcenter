            </ul>
            <h4>Responsibility Of Our Customers</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The accurate information:</strong></li>
                <p>The customer has to provide each and every detail in order to confirm the shipment, bill of lading,
                    and other documents, including the vehicle description like year, make, model, style, trim, etc.
                    Alterations and corrections can be a reason to charge extra while shipping. </p>
                <li><strong>Shipment size and condition:</strong></li>
                <p>The customer has to be transparent while making a booking about the vehicle's size and condition
                    before pickup. Additional fees may be charged in case of oversized wheels, extra-large tires, or if
                    it is a large vehicle like a limousine.</p>
                <li><strong>Customers will be responsible for preparing the vehicle:</strong></li>
                <p>The customer should acknowledge and agree that they will be responsible for preparing the vehicle for
                    transportation. Customers should remove all the tags, loose parts, and low-hanging spoilers prior to
                    shipping their vehicle.</p>
                <li><strong>Alarm:</strong></li>
                <p>They should disable all the alarm systems that are already installed in their vehicle. Or you have an
                    option to give clear instructions to the carrier about how to disengage it. If you didn't do this,
                    the carrier may need to use any reasonable means of available options to silence the alarm.</p>
                <li><strong>Personal stuff:</strong></li>
                <p>Customers are allowed to put their personal stuff that weighs under 100 pounds. It has to be put in
                    the truck or storage area of the vehicle.</p>
               

            </ul>
            <h4>Fees:</h4>
            <p>When a client places its order with the Auto Transportation Center, the company has the right to charge
                non-refundable fees of $100. The whole payment was divided into two parts. You have to pay your first
                installment (which is usually known as the initial payment) when we assign a carrier to ship your
                vehicle. The remaining balance is due when your vehicle has been delivered</p>
            <h4>Some important points regarding payment options:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Initial payment has to be done by credit card or debit card. When you make an order, please include
                    your credit or debit card details. Once the initial payment becomes due, the card will be charged.
                </li>
                <li>Please note that after the initial payment, the remaining balance should be paid in full at the time
                    of delivery. You have both options available for payment via cash, cheque, or credit card.</li>
                <li>All payments should be made in full by their due date; fees cannot be disputed for any reason,
                    including if you are dissatisfied with the service or if there are any damages to the vehicle.</li>
                <li>If you do not make payment on time or if we receive a chargeback for your payment due to any reason,
                    you have to pay extra charges. Interest will also be charged on late payments from the original due
                    date.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Fully insured:</h4>
            <p>The carrier will be responsible if any damage happens to the vehicle while shipping. Contracted carriers
                will be responsible for covering any damages or theft caused by the driver during transportation</p>
            <p>Carriers are not authorized or covered by insurance to transport personal stuff in the vehicle. We
                understand that you may need to transport some stuff in the vehicle, but please make sure that the stuff
                should be in the trunk with a total weight of 100 pounds. Extra fees may be charged if it exceeds the
                weight of 100 pounds. </p>
            <h4>Vehicle Inspection:</h4>
            <p>Under no circumstances should the client release or receive the vehicle from the carrier driver without
                any inspection, regardless of the weather conditions or time of the day. If the client is unable to do
                so, they cannot file a damage claim. Please note that any damage will be reported within 24 hours of
                delivery. Each damage has been mentioned in BOL. It is important for a customer to clearly check their
                vehicle.</p>
            <h4>Governing Law</h4>
            <p>Clients have the opportunity to seek legal counsel for advice. This agreement shall not be subjected to
                any rule of construction that ambiguities against the drafting party.</p>
            <p>The law of the state of Texas shall govern this agreement. Both parties have to be mutually agreed that
                any legal action related to this agreement will be filed in a court within Texas.</p>
            <h4>Contact information:</h4>
            <p>Questions about the terms and conditions of the service should be sent to us at
                info@autotransportationcenter.com </p>
